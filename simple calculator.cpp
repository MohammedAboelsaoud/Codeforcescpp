    long long sum = x + y;
    long long mul = 1ll* x * y;
    long long sub = x - y;

    cout << x << " + " << y << " = " << sum << endl;
    cout << x << " * " << y << " = " << mul << endl;
    cout << x << " - " << y << " = " << sub << endl;

    return 0;
}


this program was a bit hard bec of the long datatype it required **1ll on the line 9**
